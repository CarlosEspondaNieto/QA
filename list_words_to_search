Train: cuando se entrena un model con unos datos que tienen input y ouput

test: cuando se prueba ese modelo con otro dataset para verificar la efectividad del modelo, sus errores, etc. 

Supervised learning:

    you get bunch of photos with informaton what is on them and you train a model to recognize new photos
    you have bunch of molecules and information which are drugs and you train a model to answer whether new molecule is also a drug

Unsupervised learning:

    you have bunch of photos of 6 people but without information who is on which one and want to divide this dataset into 6 piles, each with photos of one individual
    you have molecules, part of them are drugs and part are not but you do not know which are which and you want algorithm to discover the drugs
